# planetary_frames
This is a project I did for my physics class in Spring Semester 2016.

The idea of this project is to demonstrate reference frames in a novel way. One of the major problems with geocentric theory was the fact that retrograde motion existed, which required complex formulation to try to understand. The introduction of the Copernican system greatly eased this problem, but I was curious to see what the planets might look like in those other reference frames.

To start, I assumed that the planetary orbits are roughly circles. This is wrong, but provides us a good approximation. Given this, this is our Copernican (Sun) frame:

By editing line 57 (see the code, which has more use instructions), we can translate to a new reference frame. Here are a few interesting ones:
Earth:

As you can tell, the retrograde motion becomes more and more pronounced as you get further away from the Sun-center system.
Also, as you get farther away, you begin to notice a sort of inner planet type system form. That raises an interesting question: would we have had a planetary-centric model for as long if humanity had grown on Jupiter? Neptune? (I personally think we wouldn't have.)
